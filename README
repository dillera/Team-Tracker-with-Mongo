Team is a simple project tracking tool for managing an off-shore team.  It includes the following features:
* tasks
* tasks with comments
* online web-based chat
* MongoDB on the backend (team-redis was the start of the same thing using Redis)
* all code and layouts in a single file
* status messages
* the ability to prioritize tasks/items by moving them up and down
